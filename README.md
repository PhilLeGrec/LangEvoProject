These are files used in the Language Evolution project at Université Côte d'Azur and University of Exeter.
I did an internship as part of this project and as part of my studies at the MSc Modelling for Neuronal and Cognitive Systems.
The files I made there are LangEvo_original (original language evolution model), LangEvo_C3 (dynamic exposure model), and StatData (initial empirical data analysis).
There will be more files added upon completion of data collection & analysis and of model refinement.
Models were based on work by Prof. Alex Mesoudi (University of Exeter).
